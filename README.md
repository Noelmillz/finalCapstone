## Usage
1. Upon running the program, the user will be presented with a menu to choose the type of calculation they want to perform.
 - investment - to calculate the amount of interest you'll earn on your investment.
 - bond - to calculate the amount you'll have to pay on a home loan.

2. To calculate the interest earned on an investment, the user should type `investment` and then provide the following inputs:
- The amount of money they are depositing.
- The interest rate (as a percentage).
- The number of years they plan on investing.
- Choose between "simple" or "compound" interest.

3. To calculate the amount they'll have to repay on a home loan (bond), the user should type `bond` and then provide the following inputs:
- The present value of the house.
- The interest rate (annual percentage).
- The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond.

4. The program will then display the calculated results based on the provided inputs.

5. It's important to note that the program is not case-sensitive, so users can type their selections in any case format (e.g., `INVESTMENT`, `Investment`, `investment`, etc.).
