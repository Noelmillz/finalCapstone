# NLP application

## Description

1. A model that allocates which mail folder an email should be sent to (work, friends, promotions, important), like Gmail’s inbox tabs.
2. A model that helps decide what grade to award to an essay question. This can be used by a university professor who grades a lot of classes or essay competitions.
